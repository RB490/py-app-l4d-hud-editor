	☐ Bug: VPK/installer: A lot of textures on l4d1 maps are messed up. Is this because left4dead2_dlc3 is actually really corrupted and the textures are overwriting it? so vpk.exe doesn't correctly extract it just ignores errors
		- Can i use the left4dead1 vpk.exe to extract this? or nosteam? how do i verify that files aren't corrupted?

	☐ Feature: Browser: Can i modify the shortcut 'control' of the gui? So pressing tab would switch from text input to the treeview. and maybe vice-versa?
	☐ Feature: BaseGUI: Toggle visibility should focus the gui & bring it to front
	☐ Feature: BaseGUI: Show() should focus the gui & bring it to front // test with the installer & remove always_on_top if possible
	
	☐ Feature: Add those large buttons to the browser that indicate the hotkeys that are available just like on my content editor, eg: syncing,browser toggling,editor menu popup

	☐ Testing: Test the program by using it to edit HUD's

	☐ Post: Idea: Threading (GUI) for lengthy operations such as shutil.rmtree mostly during install (Adds complexity) to prevent GUI's from freezing

Release:
	- Goal: Being able to have smug use the program and have it 100% work for him on first try
	☐ Version numbers
	☐ Auto updating
	☐ Link to the github repo in an 'about' gui
	☐ A way to test the program in a fresh environment. Maybe a virtual machine
	☐ Full coverage unit testing? or atleast the important parts like HudDescription/ID FileHandler/more?
	☐ Ask GPT on how to do this properly
