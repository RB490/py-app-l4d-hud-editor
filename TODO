installation issue:

current: 


    

    ☐ id file handler/installation: what happens if i install hud dev mode partially, then delete the id file, restart the program, point it to the partially installed folder? and what should happen?    
        - I should possibly set INSTALLATION_STATE to UNKNOWN same as i did with sync. 
        - Installer already handled UNKNOWN installation state

    ☐ id file: refactor: Game.Dir has 'check_for_invalid_id_file_structure' which looks like it should be part of id file class(?)

    ☐ id file: idea: create get/set keys for retrieving which mode that id file is, similar to the others get_sync get_install_state and use that throughout the program. eg: game.dir.get() uses the id file name right now, might be  better to do it like this
        - can find these instances with: id.get_file_name
        - ^ this might or might not be a good idea. in any case if i do add 'UNKNOWN' state i would have to look through the rest of my code to see where changes need to be made

    ☐ id file: refactor: installation is writing id file. im 99% sure this isnt best practice. improve this by moving it to the id file class
        # write id file
        id_path = os.path.join(dev_dir, self.game.dir.id.get_file_name(DirectoryMode.DEVELOPER))

    ☐ Sync class inspect 'get_sync_status' it sets sync state before getting it? doesnt that defeat the point

    ☐ testing: installer/id_file: perform new installation of dev folder in the same way it broke before. Which means installing about halfway then cancelling, and resuming


    ☐ Fixed shared logging filter. Couldnt filter hwnd utility shared manager

testing:

    ☐ test: Test the program by using it to edit HUD's
