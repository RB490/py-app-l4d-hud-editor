Current:

Todo:

	☐ refactor: use shared logging setup

	☐ fix: entire editor menu gets reloaded every time i toggle browser visibility causing lag
		- point of interest: opening the menu with the hotkey F8 doesn't have this lag and reloading
		- another point of interest: this doesn't happen with start->dev menu either
	☐ fix: entire editor menu gets reloaded every time i open browser 'help' menu causing lag
	☐ fix: browser menu is using images which should only happen in context menu mode

	☐ refactor: switch to send_keys_in_background from shared_utils

	☐ feat: Automatically remove invalid temp hud paths & maybe also stored hud paths

	☐ feat: Use threading/asyncio during certain parts of the installation. Mainly extracting/merging vpk's to do all jobs at once in paralel

	☐ test: Test the program by using it to edit HUD's
