Current:
	✔ Refactor: Split GUI creation into smaller methods like create_widgets>create_treeview&create_context_menu @done(23-08-28 15:51)
	✔ Refactor: Editor: start_hud_editing - ask GPT, a lot of duplicate code @done(23-08-28 15:57)
	✔ Refactor: Editor: finishg_hud_editing? @done(23-08-28 15:57)
	✔ Bug: Use browser context menu option without anything selected. Could be modified by not showing the context menu if nothing selected @done(23-08-28 16:05)

	☐ Refactor: Make start gui the main gui and browser a subgui?  OR:
		☐ Refactor: Make a little class to run the two main GUI's: Start & Browser

	☐ Testing: Test the program by using it to edit HUD's
	
	☐ Testing: Get the AHK version working and check it out to confirm feature parity
	

	☐ Feature: Readme.md -> add ahk version's readme.md with maybe some (formatting) improvements

Release:
	- GoaL: Being able to smug the program and have it 100% work for him on first try
	☐ Version numbers
	☐ Auto updating
	☐ Link to the github repo in an 'about' gui
	☐ A way to test the program in a fresh environment. Maybe a virtual machine
	☐ Full coverage unit testing? or atleast the important parts like HudDescription/ID FileHandler/more?
	☐ Ask GPT on how to do this properly

	☐ Post: Multi-game support: Explore multi-game support feasibility
	☐ Post: Command line: Evaluate potential of using command line interface instead of GUI
	☐ Post: Idea: Threading (GUI) for lengthy operations such as shutil.rmtree mostly during install (Adds complexity) to prevent GUI's from freezing
	☐ Post: Optimize and improve functions, methods, and overall structure based on GPT suggestions
	☐ Post: Enable type checking? "python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "off"
	☐ Post: Use types for variables and params and such? "python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "off"
	☐ Post: decouple classes as much as possible by passing parameters instead of directly referencing other classes
