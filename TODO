Current:
	
	☐ Bug: Load hud -> unsync hud -> browser treeview is not refreshed/cleared until after the game is reloaded?

	☐ Feature: Method to retrieve mainloop root
	☐ Feature: Debug hud should be modified so that it moves some panels around and i can actually tell its loaded in

Todo:


	- Goal: Being able to have smug use the program and have it 100% work for him on first try
	☐ Auto updating
	☐ A way to test the program in a fresh environment. Maybe a virtual machine
	☐ Full coverage unit testing? or atleast the important parts like HudDescription/ID FileHandler/more?
	☐ Ask GPT on how to do this properly
	
	
	☐ Testing: Test the program by using it to edit HUD's

Release:
