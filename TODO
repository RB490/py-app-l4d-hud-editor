Current:

	
	
	☐ Bug: Browser: Load hud -> unsync hud -> hud is unsynced, but not updated ingame

Todo:


	- Goal: Being able to have smug use the program and have it 100% work for him on first try
	☐ Auto updating
	☐ A way to test the program in a fresh environment. Maybe a virtual machine
	☐ Full coverage unit testing? or atleast the important parts like HudDescription/ID FileHandler/more?
	☐ Ask GPT on how to do this properly
	
	
	☐ Testing: Test the program by using it to edit HUD's

Release:
