☐ feat: really focus browser @ on_show. i added bring to front but the game is still focused -- it does work with other windows (might not even need bring_to_front for them)

☐ feat: use threading to speed up refreshing the browser refresh. especially noticeable when toggling gui visiblity/ toggling radio all/added and searching



☐ test: Test the program by using it to edit HUD's
