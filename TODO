✔ Found & added per module logging option for loguru @done(23-09-04 17:56)
✔ Also backup all DLC folders @done(23-09-04 20:50)
✔ Also restore all DLC folders @done(23-09-04 20:50)
✔ Refactor: Way to many get dir methods in dir.py i can combine almost all of them. _get_subdir is the most recent one @done(23-09-04 21:10)

Current:


	☐ Refactor: Installer has that find_pak01_dir's callback thing. and game.dir has __get_pak01_vpk_subdirs which do the same. use one or the other?

	☐ Modify syncer so it can delete any (custom) shit if unsycning fails - write log to file

	☐ Feature: Method to retrieve mainloop root
	
	☐ Feature: Debug hud should be modified so that it moves some panels around and i can actually tell its loaded in

Todo:


	- Goal: Being able to have smug use the program and have it 100% work for him on first try
	☐ Auto updating
	☐ A way to test the program in a fresh environment. Maybe a virtual machine
	☐ Full coverage unit testing? or atleast the important parts like HudDescription/ID FileHandler/more?
	☐ Ask GPT on how to do this properly
	
	
	☐ Testing: Test the program by using it to edit HUD's

Release:
