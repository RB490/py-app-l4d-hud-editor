Current:
	

	☐ Modify syncer so it can delete any (custom) shit if unsycning fails - write log to file. Ideas:
		- Modify the data structure so i can save all required information in one file. For example currently i save custom files in a separate object
		- Syncer currently imports the game class & imports code to restore game dev directory. that should be done in hud.start_editing instead

	☐ Feature: Menu: Game: AlwaysOnTop + remember this setting(?)
	
	☐ Feature: Browser: Modify get vanilla file to rename to default extension without .backup if needed and create a temporary copy in %temp% and return that

	☐ Feature: Menu: In AHK i had some method to keep resizing the game until it successfully did so to prevent the black window thing. i should do that in python now as its needed
	
	☐ Bug: Browser isn't visible -> unsync hud -> browser opens to clear treeview

Todo:


	- Goal: Being able to have smug use the program and have it 100% work for him on first try
	☐ Auto updating
	☐ A way to test the program in a fresh environment. Maybe a virtual machine
	☐ Full coverage unit testing? or atleast the important parts like HudDescription/ID FileHandler/more?
	☐ Ask GPT on how to do this properly
	
	
	☐ Testing: Test the program by using it to edit HUD's

Release:
