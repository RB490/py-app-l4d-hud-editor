Todo:

	☐ Testing: Test the program by using it to edit HUD's

	☐ Post: Idea: Threading (GUI) for lengthy operations such as shutil.rmtree mostly during install (Adds complexity) to prevent GUI's from freezing

Release:
	- Goal: Being able to have smug use the program and have it 100% work for him on first try
	☐ Version numbers
	☐ Auto updating
	☐ Link to the github repo in an 'about' gui
	☐ A way to test the program in a fresh environment. Maybe a virtual machine
	☐ Full coverage unit testing? or atleast the important parts like HudDescription/ID FileHandler/more?
	☐ Ask GPT on how to do this properly
