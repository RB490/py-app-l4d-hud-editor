Todo:

	☐ Refactor: switch to send_keys_in_background from shared_utils
	☐ Refactor: switch to send_keys_in_foreground from shared_utils

	☐ Feature: Update gui base with icon setting capability. root.iconphoto(True, icon) sets it in gui & taskbar. self.root.iconbitmap is obsolete?

	☐ Feature: Automatically remove invalid temp hud paths & maybe also stored hud paths

	☐ Testing: Clean environment: Test the program in a virtual machine. Bonus points for getting the game to run through a shared folder
		☐ Fix virtualbox being so laggy
		☐ Fix virtualbox not having any animations
		- Amazingly the game did run, just whining about steam not running

	☐ Feat: Use threading/asyncio during certain parts of the installation. Mainly extracting/merging vpk's to do all jobs at once in paralel

	☐ Apparently it's possible to export python as an executable after all? https://polymars.itch.io/flappuccino

	☐ Research: Ask GPT on how to properly test a program so it's ready for release
	
	☐ Research: Ask GPT on how to properly prepare a python program for release
	
	☐ Testing: Test the program by using it to edit HUD's

Release:
	☐ Goal: Being able to have third parties (smug) run the program and have it 100% work on first try
