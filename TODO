	✔ Feature: Fixed weird little gui from showing up when creating BaseGUI tktoplevel without a gui opened already @done(23-08-27 20:35)

	☐ Feature: Create hotkey for showing the context menu. Add it to help menu, too
	☐ Feature: Browser: Status bar showing 'custom' & 'added-to-hud' status?

Current:


Additional Ideas and Considerations:
	☐ Idea: Use threading GUI during lengthy operations such as shutil.rmtree during installation  (Adds complexity)
	☐ Bug: Show_browser_gui() ->  can't invoke "event" command: application has been destroyed
		- doesn't happen when showing start (so destroying browser)
		- doesn't happen when delayed by input()
		- not even an issue
		- could maybe separate creating widgets from init, and creat them when showing (only once)
	☐ make a shared folder for a python modules ask gpt and the solution I came up with is environment variable to a python module directory which gets enforced by The script // een programming en project Python Dash files
		☐ Bing says PYTHONPATH or making a package. so i can include it like any other package?
		☐ Added D:\Programming and projects\python-files\shared_modules . just needs a restart
	☐ Refactor: too-many-lines in menu.py
