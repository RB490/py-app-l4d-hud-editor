	☐ Bug: Log: Some logging printouts are printed twice. For example game dir switching (set)
		- Duplicate entries in game class: INFO:shared_utils.hwnd_window_manager:Closed False! -> log.info(f"Closed {self.get_process_name(hwnd)}!")
		- Already messed with this for longer than an hour
		- Figured out that it only happens when actually switching dir modes. If calling the same thing it doesn't duplicate
		- Figured out that when actually switching modes log statements in debug->game.py also duplicate?! very confusing stuff -- in fact all the way down the stack also in main_debug()
		- During installer's install() the pintout format is also messed up 'DEBUG:game.dir:Found install' however it doesn't seem duplicated
		- During install() copy_dir is also logging twice?

		✔ Tried removing the game class by changing it into a function @done(23-09-03 16:10)
		✔ Tried instead of making the logger a module global variable in game() i put it as part of the class @done(23-09-03 16:11)
		✔ Asked GPT a bunch @done(23-09-03 16:11)
	
	☐ Testing: Test the program by using it to edit HUD's

Release:
	- Goal: Being able to have smug use the program and have it 100% work for him on first try
	☐ Version numbers
	☐ Auto updating
	☐ Link to the github repo in an 'about' gui
	☐ A way to test the program in a fresh environment. Maybe a virtual machine
	☐ Full coverage unit testing? or atleast the important parts like HudDescription/ID FileHandler/more?
	☐ Ask GPT on how to do this properly
