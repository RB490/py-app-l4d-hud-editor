installation issue:

current: 

    ☐ id file: idea: create get/set keys for retrieving which mode that id file is, similar to the others get_sync get_install_state and use that throughout the program. eg: game.dir.get() uses the id file name right now, might be  better to do it like this
        - can find these instances with: id.get_file_name

    ☐ id file: refactor: installation is writing id file. im 99% sure this isnt best practice. improve this by moving it to the id file class
        # write id file
        id_path = os.path.join(dev_dir, self.game.dir.id.get_file_name(DirectoryMode.DEVELOPER))

    ☐ Sync class inspect 'get_sync_status' it sets sync state before getting it? doesnt that defeat the point

    ☐ testing: installer/id_file: perform new installation of dev folder in the same way it broke before. Which means installing about halfway then cancelling, and resuming

    ☐ setting user director should be done manually. if found a pre existing path, use that (parent folder) to open the folder select interface. this is because i will have multiple l4d2 installations for modding, dont want to randomly pick one

    ☐ Fixed shared logging filter. Couldnt filter hwnd utility shared manager

testing:

    ☐ test: Test the program by using it to edit HUD's
