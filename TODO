✔ Bug: Browser: Open vanilla file -> TypeError: GameDir.get_vanilla_file() missing 1 required positional argument: 'relative_file_path' @done(23-09-03 21:27)

Current:


Todo:

	☐ Feature: Browser: Double click to open file & actually opening file in general should hide the gui

	- Goal: Being able to have smug use the program and have it 100% work for him on first try
	☐ Auto updating
	☐ A way to test the program in a fresh environment. Maybe a virtual machine
	☐ Full coverage unit testing? or atleast the important parts like HudDescription/ID FileHandler/more?
	☐ Ask GPT on how to do this properly
	
	
	☐ Testing: Test the program by using it to edit HUD's

Release:
