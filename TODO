✔ Feature: Cleanup main debugging file by moving methods to separate files and keeping main() as it should be, just delegating @done(23-09-02 15:32)
✔ Feature: Installer: Update verify games prompt. as it's outdated. maybe add a timestamp for when instruction were written @done(23-09-02 15:44)
✔ Feature: Installer: Clear 'exit' from valve.rc after finishing -- infact just write my proper config as sv_consistency 0 is needed too @started(23-09-02 15:44) @done(23-09-02 15:46) @lasted(2m10s)


Current:

Todo:		
	
	☐ Feature: DevMenu: Somehow indicate which mode is currently activated. aka in the 'vanilla' path. either by disablig and/or additional entry
	☐ Feature: DevMenu: Run game option(?)
	☐ Feature: Browser: Can i modify the shortcut 'control' of the gui? So pressing tab would switch from text input to the treeview. and maybe vice-versa?
	☐ Feature: BaseGUI: Toggle visibility should focus the gui & bring it to front
	☐ Feature: BaseGUI: Show() should focus the gui & bring it to front // test with the installer & remove always_on_top if possible
	☐ Feature: Add those large buttons to the browser that indicate the hotkeys that are available just like on my content editor, eg: syncing,browser toggling,editor menu popup
	☐ Feature: Start: Closing start gui should close the program + activate user mode, most likely
	☐ Feature: Browser: Verify what close does right now and what i would like it to do + activate user mode, most likely

	☐ Bug: VPK/installer: Extracting with l4d2_vpk.exe: A lot of textures on l4d1 maps are messed up. Is this because left4dead2_dlc3 is actually really corrupted and the textures are overwriting it? so vpk.exe doesn't correctly extract it just ignores errors
		- Can i use the left4dead1 vpk.exe to extract this? or nosteam? how do i verify that files aren't corrupted?
			- Debugging idea: Extract with all the different methods, l4d1, l4d2, nosteam (old l4d1), vpk module. then compare
		- Test with any L4D1 map: map c12m4_barn


		- Alright. Confirmed. extracting it with l4d1_vpk.exe works perfect. No issues ingame. Get the latest version from steam. Add documentation
		- Still todo: How and do i want to detect if extracted files are corrupted? -- use the comparison methods for _dlc3

	☐ Testing: Test the program by using it to edit HUD's

	☐ Post: Idea: Threading (GUI) for lengthy operations such as shutil.rmtree mostly during install (Adds complexity) to prevent GUI's from freezing

Release:
	- Goal: Being able to have smug use the program and have it 100% work for him on first try
	☐ Version numbers
	☐ Auto updating
	☐ Link to the github repo in an 'about' gui
	☐ A way to test the program in a fresh environment. Maybe a virtual machine
	☐ Full coverage unit testing? or atleast the important parts like HudDescription/ID FileHandler/more?
	☐ Ask GPT on how to do this properly
