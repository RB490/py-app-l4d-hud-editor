Todo:

	
	
	☐ Feature: Menu: Run game option
	
	☐ Bug: Browser: 'todo' file without any file extension incorrectly has a folder image. 'credits' has this too
	☐ Feature: Browser: Add image for font files: .otf, .ttf, and possibly more
	
	☐ Feature: Rename installer menu option? On start & editor context menu.
	
	☐ Bug: Close hud -> Open hud -> browser refreshes -> prompt shows open hud ingame? -> close prompt -> browser resizes in height some?
		- ^ this effect is also noticable when: debug browser gui -> select radio button all/added 
		- ^ in fact this effect happens whenever resizing. so it'll be treeview refresh hitting

	☐ Refactor: Add method doc to syncer class

	









	
	
	☐ Research: Ask GPT on how to properly test a program so it's ready for release
	
	☐ Research: Ask GPT on how to properly prepare a python program for release
	
	☐ Testing: Clean environment: Test the program in a virtual machine. Bonus points for getting the game to run through a shared folder
		- Amazingly the game did run, just whining about steam not running
	
	☐ Testing: Test the program by using it to edit HUD's

		
Release:
	☐ Goal: Being able to have third parties (smug) run the program and have it 100% work on first try
