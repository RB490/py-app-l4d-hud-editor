✔ Feature: Menu: Sync option @done(23-09-07 12:25)
✔ Bug: Menu: Unsync also semi-unloads the hud from the program as the active edited hud. Don't do that @done(23-09-07 12:25)
✔ I could have a main function thing going on that determines whether a gui is open, if not, prompt to close or not or whatever @done(23-09-07 12:25)
✔ Refactor: And simplify: All the different close related code and behaviour: Slosing start/browser and close/exit on the menu @done(23-09-07 12:25)
	✔ Simplifyable: Don't close the browser @done(23-09-07 12:25)

✔ Feature: If i prompt to start editing hud ingame yes/no & decline then i need an option to do so after the fact -- could be locked behind sync or another option @done(23-09-07 14:31)
✔ Bug: No check for syncing to USER directory @done(23-09-07 14:31)
✔ Bug: Hud is being edited -> I can start/repair/update/remove/switch dir mode @done(23-09-07 14:31)

✔ Feature: Menu: Move 'open' options to their own menu @done(23-09-07 14:50)
✔ Refactor: Menu: File menu. Some options don't make sense @done(23-09-07 14:50)
✔ Idea: Instead of binding menu->open hud->hud to start_editing, i could check if the game is running, and if it isn't i could open the hud in the program but don't sync it and run game and such. basically a new method which separates start_editing and something like open_hud @done(23-09-07 14:50)

	☐ Research: Ask GPT on how to properly test a program so it's ready for release
	
	☐ Research: Ask GPT on how to properly prepare a python program for release
	
	☐ Testing: Clean environment: Test the program in a virtual machine. Bonus points for getting the game to run through a shared folder
		- Amazingly the game did run, just whining about steam not running
	
	☐ Testing: Test the program by using it to edit HUD's

		
Release:
	☐ Goal: Being able to have third parties (smug) run the program and have it 100% work on first try
