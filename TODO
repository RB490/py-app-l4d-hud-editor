✔ Refactor: ProgressGUI: Add logging @done(23-08-31 22:59)
✔ Refactor: Better naming for logging manager & logger variable? @done(23-08-31 23:01)
✔ Bug: Start -> Edit hud -> Browser does not have the hud loaded (it does load when i manually do something like reload it) @done(23-09-01 10:22)
✘ Bug: Start -> Edit hud -> hud.syncer is trying to sync 'VideoConfig'? as in the object? @cancelled(23-09-01 10:24) doesn't do it right now
✔ Bug: VDF -> Annotate -> can't add or reetrieve descriptions. i had a file with Resource\Hudlayout.res // do i want to write code to look for the resource file in the resource folder? // do i want to use the file's location in the actual hud instead? or both? @done(23-09-01 11:09)
✔ Feature: game.dir.find_resource_file @done(23-09-01 11:34)




Current:
	☐ Feature: game.dir.find_resource_file -> game.dir.get_file_relative_path

	☐ Modify the hud descriptions class to use file_name as indicator
	☐ Modify the hud descriptions class to save file_relative_path by comparing input file relative path & relative path in the header. and/or file_name in both

Vdf:

- Issue: VDF GUI used resource\hudlayout.res (from header) to retrieve hud description which is invalid because its scripts\hudlayout.res		
	☐ Thought: Should i not rely on the resource header at all? or rely on it entirely
	- ^ i should compare the file name to the file name in the resource header. if these don't match up throw an error
	- ^ i should use this verified file name to look up the resource path and save it in hud desc
	- ^ hud desc should do all of this. that should be the only location where the data is modified in any way

	- ^ should i still use relative file path to save data? or name? does it even matter? i could write code to do either, relative path seems a bit better
		- ^ relative path is arguably worse because when looking up hudlayout.res from some random location it wouldn't work right
	
	- ^ notes. not every file has a file header.
	
	
	☐ Feature: Do i want to modify my descriptions json structure? Save relative path as a subkey found with the function i just created. seems better in many ways actually. then add a method for retrieving relative path
	- ^ in fact, i probably don't even need relative path at any one point?
	- ^ definetly do this








	
Todo:		
	☐ Bug: Desc -> HudWeaponSelection is missing? didn't i have this registered before?
	
	☐ Bug: Hotkeys: Hotkeys randomly stop working. F8 to open the editor menu -> press close option -> hotkeys stop working. so instead of do_nothing it should destroy the gui?
		- ^ well, if needed, could always disable entirely. or have some way to reset the hotkey in the class or ask gpt etc

		- ^ so, it's definetly caused by the popup gui hotkey. if the hotkeys stop working, and i show and hide the popup gui again, the hotkeys continue working just fine
	☐ Bug: Hotkeys: Pressing the show editor menu hotkey while the editor menu is shown causes the show browser hotkey to stop working entirely

	☐ Bug: VPK/installer: A lot of textures on l4d1 maps are messed up. Is this because left4dead2_dlc3 is actually really corrupted and the textures are overwriting it? so vpk.exe doesn't correctly extract it just ignores errors
		- Can i use the left4dead1 vpk.exe to extract this? or nosteam? how do i verify that files aren't corrupted?

	☐ Feature: Browser: Can i modify the shortcut 'control' of the gui? So pressing tab would switch from text input to the treeview. and maybe vice-versa?
	☐ Feature: BaseGUI: Toggle visibility should focus the gui & bring it to front
	
	☐ Feature: Add those large buttons to the browser that indicate the hotkeys that are available just like on my content editor, eg: syncing,browser toggling,editor menu popup

	☐ Testing: Test the program by using it to edit HUD's

	☐ Post: Idea: Threading (GUI) for lengthy operations such as shutil.rmtree mostly during install (Adds complexity) to prevent GUI's from freezing

Release:
	- Goal: Being able to have smug use the program and have it 100% work for him on first try
	☐ Version numbers
	☐ Auto updating
	☐ Link to the github repo in an 'about' gui
	☐ A way to test the program in a fresh environment. Maybe a virtual machine
	☐ Full coverage unit testing? or atleast the important parts like HudDescription/ID FileHandler/more?
	☐ Ask GPT on how to do this properly
