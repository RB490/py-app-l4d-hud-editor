Todo:		
	☐ Bug: VPK/installer: Extracting with l4d2_vpk.exe: A lot of textures on l4d1 maps are messed up. This is because left4dead2_dlc3 needs to be extracted with l4d1 vpk.exe -- just exctract everything with l4d1.exe like i did for the ahk version
	
	
	☐ Feature: Retrieve HWND / PID in basegui?
	☐ Feature: Move function currently used to show vpk/folder export aka custom messagebox into shared utils
	☐ Feature: VDF GUI: Add some info like comments not getting saved
	☐ Feature: Start: Replace custom msgbox for export vpk/folder with context menu
	☐ Feature: Start: Consider merging add/new buttons under a context menu
	☐ Feature: Browser: Keyboard: Bind arrow up/down to select search/start
	☐ Refactor: Hotkeys: Should i move some global hotkeys to root/widget bindings? these would be gui only
	☐ Refactor: BaseGui: Create a way to reduce duplicate code with {self.root.title()}: log.debug(f"{self.root.title()} GUI always on top: {bool}")
	☐ Refactor: Use BaseGUI's self.show_context_menu_on_button
	☐ Feature: Start: CTRL+F hotkey for focusing search
	☐ Feature: Start: Move search frame below the treeview
	☐ Bug: Menu: Uninstall dev mode -> Enable dev mode -> Error
	☐ Bug: Installer: Code failed to rename the dev folder into the active game directory, because that directory already existed, without an ID file in it. Handle this some way
	☐ Bug: Installer: Uninstall: Uninstall while the game is running. Some error will be shown in terminal, however the code doesn't handle this causing the gui and code in general to just stop
	☐ Bug: Installer: Uninstall: It's quite slow deleting compared to just deleting manually with windows file explorer. probably because it's updating the gui all the time?
	☐ Bug: Installer: During rebuilding audio i get a bunch of 'failed to set window handle' before it correctly sets hwnd
	
	☐ Testing: Can i detect corrupted extracted vpk files? Debugging idea: Extract with all the different methods, l4d1, l4d2, nosteam (old l4d1), vpk module. then compare
	☐ Feature: Threading (GUI?) for lengthy operations such as shutil.rmtree mostly during install to prevent GUI's from freezing (Adds complexity, careful)
	☐ Testing: Test the program by using it to edit HUD's

Release:
	- Goal: Being able to have smug use the program and have it 100% work for him on first try
	☐ Version numbers
	☐ Auto updating
	☐ Link to the github repo in an 'about' gui
	☐ A way to test the program in a fresh environment. Maybe a virtual machine
	☐ Full coverage unit testing? or atleast the important parts like HudDescription/ID FileHandler/more?
	☐ Ask GPT on how to do this properly
