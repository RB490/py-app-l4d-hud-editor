✔ Bug: built-in todo app doesn't detect this in shared_utils.py: print(f"FIXME TODO move_hwnd_to_position: position={position}") @done(23-08-29 21:17)
✔ Feature: Create a way to sync without restoring the developer directory @done(23-08-29 21:18) write sync status id file

Current:


	☐ Refactor: Class to work with hwnds. Make it a shared util. All the current methods for working hwnds. Including focus saving&restoring

	☐ Feature: Menu: Reload modes menu should have checkboxes on them for which mode is currently selected

	☐ Testing: Test the program by using it to edit HUD's
	
	☐ Testing: Get the AHK version working and check it out to confirm feature parity

	☐ Feature: Readme.md -> add ahk version's readme.md with maybe some (formatting) improvements

Release:
	- GoaL: Being able to smug the program and have it 100% work for him on first try
	☐ Version numbers
	☐ Auto updating
	☐ Link to the github repo in an 'about' gui
	☐ A way to test the program in a fresh environment. Maybe a virtual machine
	☐ Full coverage unit testing? or atleast the important parts like HudDescription/ID FileHandler/more?
	☐ Ask GPT on how to do this properly
