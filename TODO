✔ Bug: Menu: Unsync hud -> AttributeError: 'Hud' object has no attribute 'unsync' @done(23-08-30 11:49)
✔ Feature: Menu: File -> Open file browser @done(23-08-30 11:55)
✘ Feature: Menu: Popup should refresh the menu before opening it(?) then again the menu options already do it @cancelled(23-08-30 11:58) making editor menu handler class instead
✔ Feature: A lot of print statements Process left4dead2.exe is running when startgui->start editing? Analyze & move to logging @done(23-08-30 12:34)
✔ Feature: Hotkey manager! @done(23-08-30 13:21)
✔ Bug: Sync hotkey is also sending ctrl+s but instead its typing an 's' in vscode @done(23-08-30 13:43) issue was the code execution taking too long causing issues with the keyboard hotkey module
✘ Bug: Menu: File -> Open file browser errors (without start gui having showed first, however) // this also happens for start. something slightly sus going on. something to do with the popup gui being showed first no doubt. confirm this is the case, and add a try:catch exception to the handler and/or maybe use the mainloop() check options with show_message explaining what's up @cancelled(23-08-30 13:48) non-issue just start mainloop() first

Current:
	
	☐ Feature: Editor Menu Handler class which will refresh the editor menu after every call
	

Todo:
	☐ Testing: Test the program by using it to edit HUD's
	
	☐ Testing: Get the AHK version working and check it out to confirm feature parity
		☐ Feature: Menu: Open HUD in VSCode (and that icon)

	☐ Feature: Readme.md -> add ahk version's readme.md with maybe some (formatting) improvements

Release:
	- Goal: Being able to smug the program and have it 100% work for him on first try
	☐ Version numbers
	☐ Auto updating
	☐ Link to the github repo in an 'about' gui
	☐ A way to test the program in a fresh environment. Maybe a virtual machine
	☐ Full coverage unit testing? or atleast the important parts like HudDescription/ID FileHandler/more?
	☐ Ask GPT on how to do this properly

	☐ Post: Command line: Evaluate potential of using command line interface instead of GUI
	☐ Post: Idea: Threading (GUI) for lengthy operations such as shutil.rmtree mostly during install (Adds complexity) to prevent GUI's from freezing
	☐ Post: Optimize and improve functions, methods, and overall structure based on GPT suggestions
	☐ Post: Enable type checking? "python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "off"
	☐ Post: Use types for variables and params and such? "python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "off"
	☐ Post: decouple classes as much as possible by passing parameters instead of directly referencing other classes
