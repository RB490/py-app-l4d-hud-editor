✔ Bug: Debug browser method -> Browser opens with 2020hud loaded with a bunch of files -> close -> browser resizes a bit smaller. Note that after loading another hud & closing it, this doesn't happen. Code path: handler.py -> self.hud.edit.stop_editing() -> get_browser_gui().gui_refresh() (i tested with without .gui_refresh attached, nothing happens) -> self.root.config(menu=self.editor_menu.get_main_menu()). i don't think i can fix this @done(23-09-07 16:16)	- this doesn't happen when i have resized the gui manually at all. maybe a workaround is to adjust the gui by 1 pixel -> self.root.update_idletasks()  # fixes bug where resetting the menu resizes the gui some



Current:

Todo:



		- note: this is likely a tkinter bug i can't fix or maybe not even work around

	☐ Bug: Browser treeview refreshes pretty slow

	☐ Refactor: Add method doc to syncer class

	









	
	
	☐ Research: Ask GPT on how to properly test a program so it's ready for release
	
	☐ Research: Ask GPT on how to properly prepare a python program for release
	
	☐ Testing: Clean environment: Test the program in a virtual machine. Bonus points for getting the game to run through a shared folder
		- Amazingly the game did run, just whining about steam not running
	
	☐ Testing: Test the program by using it to edit HUD's

		
Release:
	☐ Goal: Being able to have third parties (smug) run the program and have it 100% work on first try
