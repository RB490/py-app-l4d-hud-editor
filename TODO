✔ Refactor: create_temp_dir_from_input_dir_exclude_files_without_extension @done(23-08-31 21:52)
✔ Feature: Write my own VPK extract/create class. Creaton: the VPK module doesn't handle left4dead2_dlc3 properly and the way it is coded you can't suppress the error and continue extracting. it just stops extracting @done(23-08-31 21:52)


Current:

Todo:

	☐ Refactor: Modify copy_dir to ignore file extensions(?)

	☐ Feature: method to confirm validity of the dev folder. all pak01's should be disabled. merge this code into overcouples method for validiety checks

	☐ Bug: start editing hud -> open hud file -> modify it -> sync -> no changes ingame. hud is being reloaded ingame
		- ^ seems like the files are being synced. maybe some pak01 is enabled?

	☐ Testing: Test the program by using it to edit HUD's

	☐ Post: Idea: Threading (GUI) for lengthy operations such as shutil.rmtree mostly during install (Adds complexity) to prevent GUI's from freezing

Release:
	- Goal: Being able to have smug use the program and have it 100% work for him on first try
	☐ Version numbers
	☐ Auto updating
	☐ Link to the github repo in an 'about' gui
	☐ A way to test the program in a fresh environment. Maybe a virtual machine
	☐ Full coverage unit testing? or atleast the important parts like HudDescription/ID FileHandler/more?
	☐ Ask GPT on how to do this properly
