Todo:

	☐ Feature: Adjust start so it also displays which hud is being edited?
	☐ Feature: Adjust start so it can also stop editing. Rename the edit button to 'stop editing' when selecting the edited hud & edit / disable as normal when selecting a different hud
	☐ Feature: Adjust hud.edit so it


	☐ I could have a main function thing going on that determines whether a gui is open, if not, prompt to close or not or whatever

	☐ Refactor: And simplify: All the different close related code and behaviour: Slosing start/browser and close/exit on the menu
		- Simplifyable: Don't close the browser

	☐ Refactor: Menu: File menu. Some options don't make sense
		☐ Having an installer option
		☐ A close & exit option // maybe rena
	
	☐ Research: Ask GPT on how to properly test a program so it's ready for release
	
	☐ Research: Ask GPT on how to properly prepare a python program for release
	
	☐ Testing: Clean environment: Test the program in a virtual machine. Bonus points for getting the game to run through a shared folder
		- Amazingly the game did run, just whining about steam not running
	
	☐ Testing: Test the program by using it to edit HUD's

		
Release:
	☐ Goal: Being able to have third parties (smug) run the program and have it 100% work on first try
