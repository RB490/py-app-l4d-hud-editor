✔ Bug: Menu: Unsync hud -> AttributeError: 'Hud' object has no attribute 'unsync' @done(23-08-30 11:49)
Current:

	Hotkey:
		- interestingly the F8 hotkey to open the editor menu still works fine?
		☐ Bug: Start editing -> Press F7 to open browser -> nothing at all
		☐ Bug: Start editing -> Press ctrl+s to sync -> nothing at all?
		☐ Bug: Start editing -> F12 to unsync hud with debug method -> nothing
		☐ Bug: Start editing -> F10 for debug method -> nothing at all?

	☐ Feature: Menu: File -> Open file browser
	☐ Feature: A lot of print statements Process left4dead2.exe is running when startgui->start editing? Analyze & move to logging

	☐ Testing: Test the program by using it to edit HUD's
	
	☐ Testing: Get the AHK version working and check it out to confirm feature parity
		☐ Feature: Menu: Open HUD in VSCode (and that icon)

	☐ Feature: Readme.md -> add ahk version's readme.md with maybe some (formatting) improvements

Release:
	- Goal: Being able to smug the program and have it 100% work for him on first try
	☐ Version numbers
	☐ Auto updating
	☐ Link to the github repo in an 'about' gui
	☐ A way to test the program in a fresh environment. Maybe a virtual machine
	☐ Full coverage unit testing? or atleast the important parts like HudDescription/ID FileHandler/more?
	☐ Ask GPT on how to do this properly

	☐ Post: Idea: Threading (GUI) for lengthy operations such as shutil.rmtree mostly during install (Adds complexity) to prevent GUI's from freezing
