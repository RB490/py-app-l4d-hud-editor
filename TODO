Current:
	☐ Feature: Browser closing should have a confirmation dialog about are you sure

	☐ Feature: Global hotkey manager: Method to set up global (debug) hotkeys seems pretty useful right now to say the least. 

	☐ Testing: Test the program by using it to edit HUD's
	
	☐ Testing: Get the AHK version working and check it out to confirm feature parity

	☐ Feature: Readme.md -> add ahk version's readme.md with maybe some (formatting) improvements

	☐ Refactor: Cleanup redundant print statements

Release:
	- GoaL: Being able to smug the program and have it 100% work for him on first try
	☐ Version numbers
	☐ Auto updating
	☐ Link to the github repo in an 'about' gui
	☐ A way to test the program in a fresh environment. Maybe a virtual machine
	☐ Full coverage unit testing? or atleast the important parts like HudDescription/ID FileHandler/more?
	☐ Ask GPT on how to do this properly
