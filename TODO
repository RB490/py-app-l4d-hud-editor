✔ Bug: main.pyw doesn't seem to do anything when running through normal file explorerer @done(23-08-28 20:15)

Current:
	✔ Feature: developer menu: add confirmation for enable/disable aswell. @done(23-08-28 20:20)
	☐ Feature: developer menu: add text labels explaining more information
	☐ Feature: on script exit disable dev mode
	☐ Feature: developer menu: instead rename enable/disable to maybe more descriptive and/or increase understandability with label so: user mode: dev mode
	
	☐ Refactor: Make start gui the main gui and browser a subgui? apparently it really is best practice to have 1 main gui
		☐ OR: Refactor: Make a little class to run the two main GUI's: Start & Browser

	☐ Testing: Test the program by using it to edit HUD's
	
	☐ Testing: Get the AHK version working and check it out to confirm feature parity

	☐ Feature: Readme.md -> add ahk version's readme.md with maybe some (formatting) improvements

Release:
	- GoaL: Being able to smug the program and have it 100% work for him on first try
	☐ Version numbers
	☐ Auto updating
	☐ Link to the github repo in an 'about' gui
	☐ A way to test the program in a fresh environment. Maybe a virtual machine
	☐ Full coverage unit testing? or atleast the important parts like HudDescription/ID FileHandler/more?
	☐ Ask GPT on how to do this properly

	☐ Post: Enable type checking? "python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "off"
	☐ Post: Use types for variables and params and such? "python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "off"
	☐ Post: decouple classes as much as possible by passing parameters instead of directly referencing other classes
