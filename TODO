☐ feat: menu: verify input params eg isinstance BaseGUI & EditorMenuGUI & IsEditorMenuConfigClass

☐ refactor: menu: i think i should modify create_and_refresh_menu, both the title, and maybe also the fact that it calls the gui backwards?
    ☐ feat: menu: main menu: create_and_refresh_menu & similar methods. possibly return an actual menu of directly modifying it? similar to how create_menu for the create menu classes returns a menu



☐ test: Test the program by using it to edit HUD's
