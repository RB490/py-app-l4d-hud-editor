    'run once a day' code:
        ☐ feature: upgrade the run once a day code check and make it available in shared managers (keep in mind that it's shared code and save it based on program name or w/e)
            ☐ have an optional argument where i specify the amount of time in minutes or hours and default it to 24 hours

        ☐ feature: use the shared 'run once a day' code for updating version number from git (version number code was shared aswell possibly integrate it right in)
            - ^ use timing code to test how much time this takes first, this might not be needed. although might be nice to do anyway

testing:

    ☐ test: Test the program by using it to edit HUD's
