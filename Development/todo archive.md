feature -> finish hud editor menu + hotkey
	^ apparently this isn't quite possible very conveniently with python
	looks like i will probably create a gui with a menu bar. and some big buttons for commonly used features

	- visually display hotkeys
	- menu bar
	^ have every option in the menubar and certain more useful options also on the gui

	^ could also consider adding a hide window command to every menu entry so that it closes on selecting
		^ could do both. keep the gui and buttons but also hide it on selecting - i want to do that anyways
