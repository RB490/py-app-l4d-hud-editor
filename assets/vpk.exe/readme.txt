left4dead (steam version)
	use this to create vpk's
	seems to work as intended, atleast for creating vpks.  creates corruped files when extracting pak01_dir's

left4dead2 (steam  version)
	has some weird debug info enabled and creates corruped files when extracting pak01_dir's

nosteam (from the russian l4d piratebay ripoff? can't remember. older vpk.exe version)
	use this to extract pak01_dir.vpk's
	for some reason the vpk.exe included with l4d1 & 2 doesn't extract pak01_dirs properly
		maybe it's been updated while the pak01_dirs are still the same
