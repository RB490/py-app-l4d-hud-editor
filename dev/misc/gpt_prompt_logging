replace print statements with logging

rules for your response:
- keep all comments. don't remove any comments
- keep all documentation like method docs
- keep all lines of code
- print out every single line of my code, so don't use abbrevations like: # ... (other methods unchanged), # ... (other methods and docstrings unchanged). i want to be able to copy your response and replace my entire code 
- use f-strings in the logging statements
- consider which logging level each print statement should be

- Use this code to setup:
logger_manager = LoggerManager(__name__, level=logging.WARNING)  # Pass the desired logging level
logger_manager = LoggerManager(__name__, level=logging.CRITICAL + 1)  # turns off
logger = logger_manager.get_logger()  # Get the logger instance


here is my code:
