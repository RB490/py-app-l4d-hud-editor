replace print statements with logging

rules for your response:
- keep all comments. don't remove any comments
- keep all documentation like method docs
- keep all lines of code
- print out every single line of my code, so don't use abbrevations like: # ... (other methods unchanged), # ... (other methods and docstrings unchanged). i want to be able to copy your response and replace my entire code 
- use f-strings in the logging statements
- consider which logging level each print statement should be
- set logging to: logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
- also print line to set  logging to: logging.basicConfig(level=logging.CRITICAL + 1)  # turns off logging
- disable pylint warning 'logging-fstring-interpolation' modify existing statement if availabe. else create a new one

here is my code:
