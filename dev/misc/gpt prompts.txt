 ### general
 
 python function. when should i return true or false, or raise exception

 #### class

 have a class for managing my left 4 dead 2 directory for my python hud editor:

the main class has a few subclasses:
window - handles running the game window, and closing it. etc.
installer - modifies the game directory
commands - executes commands to the game window

if i want to store the constant variable 'left 4 dead 2' where should it be defined?
