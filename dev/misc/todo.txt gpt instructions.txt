Optimize and organize my todo file:

Given the list of tasks in my todo file, please use your natural language processing abilities to help me clean up and structure the tasks more effectively. Consider categorizing tasks, and condensing any duplicate or redundant entries. Feel free to rephrase task descriptions for clarity and brevity. The goal is to create a more streamlined and actionable todo list that helps me focus and stay productive.

Feel free to include headings like 'Refactoring', 'Features', and 'Bugs' to further categorize the tasks.

Create categories with a colon like this 'Example category:'
Create tasks with ☐ at the start of the sentence like this: '☐ Example task'

You can add tasks to categories by using 1 tab of indentation
You can create subtasks by using 2 tabs of indentation

Formatting:
You can format text in a markdown-like fashion
Bold: Use asterisks for *bold*
Italic: Use underscores for _italic_
Strikethrough: Use tildes for ~strikethrough~
Code: Use backticks for `code`

this_is_an_example_category:
	☐ this_is_an_example_task
		☐ this_is_an_example_sub_task
			☐ this_is_an_example_sub_task_two_levels_deep


Print the output in a code block.
If there are any tasks that seem unclear or require additional context, you can ask for clarification. Please ensure that the final output remains coherent and easy to understand. Thanks for your assistance
